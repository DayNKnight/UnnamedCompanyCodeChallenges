This repo is for the two coding challenges that I did for an unnamed company's interview. 
I am not sure of the usual processes of what I can and can't post on here regarding coding challenges for interviews, so I will not name them.
I only ended up submitting the L3 challenge, as that is the one that I was the most proud of.
